    <p>It's been so long that I have stared on my screen, zoned out while crying, and I still don't know what to say. It's all my fault, this wouldn't have happened if I didn't make a stupidly absurd and unnecessary issue out of something simple. Tita wouldn't have seen our conversations only if I didn't start making unreasonable issues earlier. I'm sorry for being an overemotional person, I have never been like this in my life other than recently, and I don't know what has gotten me to become the type of person to make an issue over the simplest and understandable things, like I have just been pulling problems out of my ass for no reason. I guess me wanting to get more attention from you is part of it, and I'm sorry for that. I'm sorry for everything. I'm sorry for all the negativity and problems that I have been causing. I know that saying sorry will do completely nothing to help with everything that I have caused, but I just don't know what to say anymore. I'm disappointed of myself, I'm tired of being who I currently am, and I have just no words for myself and how bad of a boyfriend I have been. I think things have been much better for you at the time that I still haven't gotten to meet you. I'm sorry for ruining everything.<br><br>The issues that I have made yesterday are nothing, seriously. I don't know what has gotten into my mind when I said all of that, but I never meant anything that I said. I know that this sounds stupid, but I wasn't in control of everything that I have said. Everything that I have said last night, seriously doesn't represent how I have been feeling. I'm really sorry that our last conversation was full of negativity and issues that we didn't get to resolve in a healthy way, but please treat what you're reading right now as our last conversation, even if you won't be able to reply back as you read these. Actually, there is nothing that needs to be resolved, there has never been any actual problems in the first place and last night I for some reason kept digging for every bit of negativity that I could find in every corner of our relationship, something that is completely unreasonable to do and I really don't know why I had to do that. I know that it's hard to believe, but everything that I have said last night aren't something that I'm actually upset about. You didn't even have to say sorry for that, you never did anything wrong. It's just that I have extreme mood swings and extreme attention seeking behaviour that makes me do these unreasonable things, and I deeply hate myself for that. I'm sorry for being a failure.<br><br>I'm your boyfriend, so I'm supposed to be a good partner in life that will always be here to help you with everything, to make your life so much better by being here to support you in every way possible, to fight with you in battles that you have to face so that you will never be alone in battling with whatever life throws at you, and so much more. But I seem to be doing the opposite, and instead just bring so much negativity and cause so much problems, making your life more heavier. Please never blame yourself for what happened, it's all my fault, I was the reason why tita even found out about our relationship. I don't know how I can even apologize for this, my apology will do nothing to help even to the slightest in this situation. I want to call the number that you gave me and prove to tita how much I really love you, how much I'm willing to take care of you and do everything I can for you, and so much more... But at the same time, It's really hard for me to do because I might worsen the situation. From the notebook, I remember reading that tita doesn't believe in genuine love and doesn't care about genuine love, and what she thinks is the most important thing in a relationship is money. You also said that she fully believes that relationships at our age will fail, which is absolutely not true. If I talk to her, I'm scared that I'm gonna only worsen the situation. I'm sorry for what I'm about to say, but I think the best decision would be to pretend that you broke up with me and pretend that you didn't know what got into your mind, and you cut contact with me. I think it would be better to let her forget about everything, I think it's not the right time for us to prove our relationship to her yet.<br><br>I don't know how long you will be gone, but I really wish that we can still get to talk to each other even just for a few minutes every single day, though I understand that trying to secretly get the phone and talk to me would risk her giving you a much worse punishment if she sees you and I don't want that to happen. Please stay safe, and try to find happiness during times that we won't be able to talk. Please don't skip a meal, try to eat as much as possible and try to enjoy every bit of the food you get to eat every day and night. I wish that I could teleport to your room every night that you go to sleep, cuddle with you and act as your little blanket, I really wish that I was there with you right now. I also hope that you have a good sleep every night. I hope that even if we're not able to talk, you still get all the rest that you deserve. I want you to have a peaceful good night sleep every night, and have the sweetest dreams.<br><br>I'm sorry for being a bad boyfriend again. I know that sorry is not just a word, it's a promise to change. From now on, I will be working on being a better version of myself.</p>
